A straight-forward interface to retrieving performance timing metrics.

### What does it do for me?
Retrieve metrics if they are available, otherwise, set up an observer to be resolved with extracted entries, then disconnected.

```js
import { getEntries } from 'performance-timing';

const [ navigation ] = await getEntries('navigation'); // PerformanceNavigationTiming{}
```

More Examples
```js
const [ firstInpt ] = await getEntries('first-input'); // PerformanceEventTiming{}
const resources = await getEntries('resource'); // [PerformanceResourceTiming{}, ...]
```

Mixed results
```js
const entries = await getEntries('navigation', 'paint');
```
